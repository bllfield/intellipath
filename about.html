        <h1>Why We Exist</h1>
        <p>We're on a mission to make energy work for people — not the other way around. By combining transparency, smart technology, and a deep understanding of real-world household needs, we're building tools that simplify energy decisions and put control back where it belongs: in the hands of the customer.</p>

            <h2>Built by a Customer Who Cracked the Code</h2>
            <p>Intellipath wasn't born from a business plan — it was born from frustration.</p>
            <p>Founder Brian Littlefield spent years in finance, helping families plan for their future and take control of their budgets. One expense kept slipping through the cracks: electricity.</p>
            <p>Not because people were using too much — but because they had no idea what they should be paying.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">Then it got personal.</p>
            <p>Brian spotted the same patterns in his own home — unpredictable bills, vague rates, and plans that seemed designed to confuse instead of help. Later, while working in the solar industry, he saw the same problem from the inside: a system built on complexity and misaligned incentives.</p>
            <p>So he set out to build the tool he wished he had.</p>

        <h2>The Problem: Energy Isn't Just a Cost — It's a Blind Spot</h2>
        <p>Most households don't track how much energy they use, when they use it, or what it truly costs them. The result?</p>
        <p class="emphasis">Hundreds — sometimes thousands — in overpayments each year.</p>
        <p>That's not just a budgeting issue.<br>That's a system failure — one designed to keep customers in the dark.</p>

        <h2>The Mission: Clear, Confident Energy Decisions</h2>
        <p>At Intellipath, we believe better decisions start with better data.</p>
        <p>We use cutting-edge tools, proprietary algorithms, and AI technology to analyze real usage patterns and uncover what's really going on behind your bill.</p>
        <p>Then we show you the best path forward — whether that means switching plans, shifting usage habits, or making simple changes to reduce your energy waste.</p>
        <div class="mission-highlights">
          <p class="emphasis">No sales pressure.<br>No guessing.<br>Just clear, personalized insights built around what works for you.</p>

          <div class="vision-text">
            <p>What started with one frustrated customer has grown into a smarter energy platform for households across the country.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">Our goal is simple:</p>
            <p>Empower people to take control of their energy — and stop overpaying for power they don't need.</p>
            <p>Because when enough people get access to real energy intelligence, the system starts to work the way it should: for the customer.</p>
