        <h1>Why We Exist</h1>
        <p>We're on a mission to make energy work for people — not the other way around. By combining transparency, smart technology, and a deep understanding of real-world household needs, we're building tools that simplify energy decisions and put control back where it belongs: in the hands of the customer.</p>

            <p>Intellipath wasn't born from a business plan — it was born from frustration. Our founder, Brian Littlefield, spent years in finance and later in solar, only to realize both industries shared the same fatal flaw: misaligned incentives. Customers were often left in the dark while companies profited off their confusion. That realization sparked a deeper mission — not to sell more energy products, but to empower smarter energy decisions.</p>
            <p>Intellipath exists to flip the system on its head. We don't chase commissions. We chase outcomes that actually help people — outcomes that save money, reduce waste, and build long-term trust. We're not just solving energy inefficiency. We're solving informational inefficiency — with tools, insights, and recommendations designed around what's right, not what sells.</p>

        <h2>Where We're Going</h2>
        <p>We're working toward a future where energy is no longer confusing, frustrating, or out of reach — where every household understands how their home uses power, and has the tools to take control of it.</p>
        <p>Our vision is to transform how energy is delivered, explained, and experienced. Not through gimmicks or guesswork, but through simple, powerful solutions that put people first. We're creating a world where transparency is the norm, smart choices are effortless, and energy finally works the way it should — for the homeowner.</p>

            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p>We earn trust by showing our work. Every recommendation we make — from plan comparisons to usage breakdowns — is backed by real data, not marketing spin.</p>

          <div class="value-item">
            <h3>Innovation</h3>
            <p>We don't accept the way things have always been done. We challenge outdated systems and build smarter, faster, more practical tools for real homes and real people.</p>

            <h3>Impact Over Hype</h3>
