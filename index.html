        <h2>Built to Fix a Broken System</h2>
        <p>The energy industry thrives on confusion — complicated plans, vague bills, and misaligned incentives. We were founded to break that cycle. Our mission is simple: give every household access to smarter, clearer, and more cost-effective energy decisions.</p>
        <p>From AI-powered analysis to transparent plan switching, every tool we build is designed around one goal: make energy work for people, not the other way around.</p>

            <h2>Built by a Customer Who Cracked the Code</h2>
            <p>Intellipath was born from two perspectives: one as a frustrated customer, and the other as a financial advisor who had seen too many clients quietly bleeding money on their energy bills. Our founder, Brian Littlefield, began noticing it in his own home — monthly charges that didn't add up, confusing plans, and pricing that seemed to punish loyalty instead of rewarding it.</p>
            <p>At the same time, he was helping families manage their budgets and plan for the future — and a pattern started to emerge. Energy wasn't just a cost. It was a blind spot. People weren't overpaying by a few dollars — they were overpaying by hundreds, sometimes thousands, each year. Not because they used too much, but because the system made it nearly impossible to know what they should be paying.</p>
            <p>That's where Intellipath comes in.</p>
            <p>We don't sell electricity. We don't pitch upgrades. We build tools that help you understand your usage, compare plans, and stop overpaying — for good. It's your energy. You should be in control. We're here to make that possible.</p>

            <h2>We're Building the Energy Ecosystem of the Future</h2>
            <p>Intellipath is more than a switching site or a savings app. It's the foundation for a complete home energy intelligence platform. We're building tools that understand your usage, optimize your options, and evolve with your needs — from your first plan comparison to full energy independence.</p>
            <p>This is just the beginning. As the energy landscape shifts, we'll be the platform leading the way — smarter, faster, and always on the side of the homeowner.</p>
